  <h1 class="display-4">DnD Campaign</h1>
 <p>Normally when I am playing Dnd I particiapate as a player meaning all I have to do is show up with a character and participate in a story that is made or at least narrated 
by the dungeon master (DM). I was starting to feel bad that our resident DM never got a chance to be a player so I did a lot of research on how to be an effective DM. I 
started off with existing modules meaning campaigns that already exist and all I needed to do was narrate the campaign for the players. after I got comfortable in the role. 
I tried my hand at homebrewing my own campaign meaning I made my own story and the world for the players to play in. Admittedly the balance of the world was far from perfect
but the act of creating a whole story from scratch really exercised my creative muscles. Even if I did not homebrew my own world, narrating a Dnd campaign allowed me to 
practice my improvisation skills as well. Because the players are free to do nearly whatever they like, it is my job to keep the story going without necessarily knowing 
what the players might do.</p>
