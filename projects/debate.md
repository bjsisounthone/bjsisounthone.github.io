summary: "My experience as a competing member of the UH Debate Team"
---

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/vacay/vacay-home-page.png">

I started debating at Leeward Community College around 2015. When I transferred to UH Manoa, I also joined the debate team. I eventually made my way onto one of the 
competing teams.

As a competing team member, not only would we compete in local tournaments, but we would also travel to different debate tournaments across the USA.
The tournaments I have taken part in include The LaVerne tournament in California and the Yale tournament in New Haven.

Once a year, there is a world tournament called WUDC which is hosted in a different country every year. The one I participated in was hosted in Mexico. 

I found my experience on the Debate team to be very enriching. Not only did it give me an excuse to research many different topics, but it also forced me to be up to date with many current events happening around the world. Moreover, even if I was not debating competitively, the act of debating helped me overcome my stage fright.
