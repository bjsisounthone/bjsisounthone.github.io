  <h2 id="directionless">Directionless</h2>

<p>When it comes to software engineering, I would say that I am a late bloomer. Growing up I didn’t really have any direction in life and when it came time to attend college, I chose a major half-heartedly.<br />
After finishing my first degree and entering the workforce, I felt unsatisfied with how I was spending my life. 
Therefore, on many occasions, I would watch various tutorials online to teach myself how to code.<br />
I say “many” because I had also quit teaching myself many times as well.</p>

<h2 id="seize-the-moment">Seize the moment</h2>

<p>I knew that I enjoyed the process of learning to code every time I did it, but I was at a stage in my life where I could not afford to do something I would enjoy if it wasn’t also profitable. 
Eventually, many life situations happened, and I finally found the time to dedicate to learning how to code. 
Because I felt like this opportunity would not come again, I wanted to do this process right. 
I decided to go back to school and acquire a formal education on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="new-beginnings">New beginnings</h2>

<p>The reason why I wanted to learn this skill in a school setting was because I had many opportunities to teach myself this subject matter and I came to realize that although I could learn the syntax of a language, I had no idea how to apply this information. 
I knew that people made projects, but I didn’t have the slightest idea what projects to do. 
My hope is that the structure of a school setting will give me the direction I need to take my software engineering skills to the next level. 
Ultimately, by the end of my return to school, and my second degree I hope to be able to apply the concepts I learn in class and have a bunch of projects in my portfolio as proof that I can apply the concepts I’ve learned.</p>
